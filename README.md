# Ball and Plate Control  
### Modern Control Course Project 

## Overview
This project addresses one of the most well–known under–actuated benchmark problems in control engineering: the **Ball and Plate System**.

The goal is to model the nonlinear dynamics, linearize the system around the equilibrium point, and design controllers and observers that ensure:

- closed-loop stability  
- accurate reference tracking  
- disturbance rejection  
- robustness against uncertainty and noise  
- feasibility under actuator constraints  

The project follows a complete modern control pipeline from modeling to digital implementation.

## Objectives
- Derive nonlinear equations of motion using the Euler–Lagrange method  
- Obtain linear state–space representation  
- Analyze stability, controllability, and observability  
- Design state feedback controllers  
- Implement static and dynamic pre–compensators  
- Design an optimal LQR controller  
- Build full and reduced order observers  
- Apply Kalman filtering  
- Evaluate robustness in presence of noise and disturbances  
- Implement discrete-time control

## System Description
A ball rolls on a flat plate whose inclination is adjusted by two actuators along orthogonal axes.

Although the ball moves in two directions, the number of control inputs is limited → the system is **under–actuated** and open-loop unstable.

### States
Typical state variables include:
- Ball position: `x`, `y`
- Ball velocity: `x_dot`, `y_dot`
- Plate angles: `α`, `β`
- Angular velocities

### Inputs
- Torques / angular accelerations generated by motors.

### Outputs
- Usually the ball position measured by a vision system.

---

## Modeling
The nonlinear model is derived from energy relations:

\[
L = T - V
\]

which produces coupled nonlinear differential equations for ball motion and plate dynamics.

---

## Linearization
Linearization is performed around the equilibrium:



Jacobian matrices are computed in MATLAB.

## System Analysis
We study the following properties:

- Eigenvalue stability  
- Lyapunov stability  
- BIBO stability  
- Controllability  
- Observability  
- Kalman decomposition  
- Jordan canonical form  
- Transfer matrix  
- Pole–zero maps  
- Zero-input and zero-state responses

## Controller Design

### State Feedback
Pole placement is used to stabilize the system and shape transient dynamics.

### Pre–Compensators
To remove steady-state tracking error:
- Static pre–compensator  
- Dynamic pre–compensator  

are designed and compared.

### LQR – Optimal Control

The LQR controller is obtained by minimizing a quadratic performance index that penalizes deviations of the system states from the desired equilibrium while also limiting the magnitude of the control inputs. This formulation provides a systematic trade-off between tracking performance and control effort.

---

## Observers
Since all states are not directly measurable, we implement:

- Full-order Luenberger observer  
- Reduced-order observer  

and evaluate estimation accuracy.

---

## Noise & Disturbance Study
The system performance is tested under:

- white measurement noise  
- parameter uncertainty  
- external disturbances  

Robustness of the closed loop is analyzed.

---

## Actuator Limitations
Realistic physical constraints such as saturation and motor bounds are included in simulations.

---

## Discrete Implementation
Controllers and observers are discretized and implemented with sampling and rate transitions.

---

## Kalman Filter
A Kalman filter is designed to provide optimal state estimation in noisy environments and is compared with deterministic observers.

---

## Simulation Tools
- MATLAB  
- Simulink  
- Simscape

## Example Workflow
1. Build nonlinear model  
2. Linearize  
3. Check controllability / observability  
4. Design controller  
5. Add compensator  
6. Add observer  
7. Add noise & actuator limits  
8. Discretize  
9. Evaluate tracking & robustness  

---

## Results
The final system achieves:

✅ stabilization of the unstable equilibrium  
✅ successful trajectory tracking  
✅ disturbance attenuation  
✅ acceptable behavior under noise  
✅ improved estimation using Kalman filtering
